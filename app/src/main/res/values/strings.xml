    <string name="info_fragment_api_text">All contents of this app are being displayed using NASA Mars Rover Photos REST API v1.0.\nThis API
        allows you to collect image data gathered by NASA\'s Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars.\n\nEach rover has its own set
        of photos stored in the database, that are capable of being queried separately. Along with querying by date, results can be filtered
        by the camera.\n\nResponses are limited to 25 photos per call for unregistered key. NASA open data supports NASA\'s scientists
        and engineers with information technology such as infusion, procurement, and future IT workforce development.</string>
